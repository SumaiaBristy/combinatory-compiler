#Msc Thesis Project

**About projects**: –	Designed and implemented a Combinatory Compiler to compile strongly typed functional programming language based on PCF using Java (JDK-21), emphasizing immutability, type safety, and pure functions.
–	Developed custom Java parsers with JParsec 3.1 to construct and validate program syntax, ensuring type safety.
–	Translated functional programs into a combinator-based language, eliminating variables to streamline execution.
–	Developed an abstract machine and executed the PCF programs in Java using a push-back stack mechanism.
–	Compiled the abstract machine into an x86 assembler to produce executable code.
–	The built Abstract machine is implementable in software like VM and could potentially be built as a custom processor.
–	Executable version (x86 assembler) can be run directly on x86 hardware or in an emulator.
–	Implemented the full pipeline from functional source code to executable machine code, showcasing advanced understanding of compiler design, functional programming semantics, and systems-level.

**Technologies**: Core Java, Web Assembly, PCF, Functional Programming language, Eclipse, JDK 21
Compilation of a Functional Programming Language, PCF using Combinators(call_by_name: (S,K,I,Y) and call_by_values(INT, BOOL(TURE/FALSE),CONDITIONAL(IF..THEN..ELSE),ADD,SUB,MUL,EQ,LEQ,AND,OR,NOT,NAMEDTERM))

**How to run the Projects?**
1. clone the repository
2. go to src-> TextEditor.java and run
3. A JFrame window will be open. Input into the Frame window.
4. check the **exe** folder in the **asm** directory.
5. After every compilation a new executable file would be generated.
